            <h2>Extinction of Dinosaurs</h2>
            <p>The mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago marked the end of the Cretaceous period and led to the extinction of approximately 75% of Earth's species, including the dinosaurs. This event is commonly attributed to a massive asteroid impact.</p>
            <p>The impact created the Chicxulub crater in present-day Mexico, leading to dramatic changes in the climate, including darkness and cooling due to debris blocking sunlight. This disruption in the climate affected plant life and, consequently, the herbivorous dinosaurs.</p>
            <p>Other theories suggest volcanic activity, such as the Deccan Traps eruptions, might have contributed to the extinction by releasing large amounts of volcanic gases and ash into the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>The extinction paved the way for the rise of mammals and the eventual evolution of modern species. Understanding these extinction events helps us learn about the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Post-Extinction Impact</h2>
            <p>The extinction of dinosaurs led to significant changes in the Earth's ecosystems. Mammals, which had previously been small and relatively inconspicuous, began to diversify and occupy the ecological niches left vacant by the dinosaurs.</p>

            <p>Floral and faunal shifts during the Paleogene period set the stage for the evolution of modern ecosystems. The fossil record shows a gradual recovery and diversification of life forms in the aftermath of the extinction event.</p>
