            <h2>The Cretaceous Period</h2>
            <p>The Cretaceous period, extending from about 145 to 66 million years ago, was the last and longest segment of the Mesozoic Era. It is known for its advanced and diverse dinosaur fauna, including the infamous Tyrannosaurus rex and the horned Triceratops.</p>
            <p>During this time, the continents continued to drift apart, leading to the formation of the modern oceans and continents. This period also saw a significant rise in flowering plants, which provided new food sources for herbivorous dinosaurs.</p>
            <p>The Cretaceous period is renowned for its large theropods and the evolutionary development of many dinosaur groups. Notable species include the long-necked Brachiosaurus and the armored Ankylosaurus.</p>

            <p>The end of the Cretaceous period was marked by a mass extinction event that wiped out most dinosaur species, setting the stage for the rise of mammals and the eventual dominance of modern flora and fauna.</p>
