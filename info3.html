            <h2>Dinosaur Fossils</h2>
            <p>Dinosaur fossils provide valuable insights into the lives of these ancient creatures. Fossils include bones, teeth, footprints, and even preserved nests. These remnants help scientists understand dinosaur anatomy, behavior, and environments.</p>
            <p>Different types of fossils, such as skeletal remains and coprolites (fossilized dung), offer clues about diet, growth patterns, and interactions among species. Fossilized footprints can reveal information about dinosaur movement and social behavior.</p>
            <p>Fossilization is a rare process, and conditions must be just right for remains to be preserved. Sedimentary rock formations and rapid burial increase the chances of fossilization, allowing paleontologists to uncover these ancient remains.</p>

            <p>Major fossil discoveries around the world, such as in Montana's Hell Creek Formation, have significantly contributed to our understanding of the late Cretaceous period and its inhabitants.</p>

            <h2>Fossil Discovery</h2>
            <p>The discovery of dinosaur fossils often involves fieldwork and excavation in sedimentary rock formations. Paleontologists use careful excavation techniques to uncover and preserve fossils, which are then studied in laboratories.</p>

            <p>Advancements in technology, such as CT scanning and digital reconstruction, have enhanced our ability to study and interpret dinosaur fossils, providing deeper insights into their biology and evolution.</p>
