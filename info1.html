            <h2>Diet of Dinosaurs</h2>
            <p>Dinosaur diets varied greatly depending on their species and environment. Herbivorous dinosaurs, such as the Triceratops, consumed a variety of vegetation including ferns, conifers, and cycads. Their diets were essential for their growth and survival in different habitats.</p>
            <p>Carnivorous dinosaurs, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, primarily fed on other animals. Their sharp teeth and powerful jaws were adapted to tearing through flesh and bone. They played a critical role in the ecosystem as top predators.</p>
            <p>Omnivorous dinosaurs, such as the Oviraptor, had a mixed diet, eating both plants and animals. This adaptability allowed them to survive in diverse and changing environments.</p>

            <p>Different species had unique adaptations to their diets. Fossilized dung, or coprolites, provide insights into the dietary habits of various dinosaurs, revealing the types of plants and animals they consumed.</p>

            <h2>Herbivorous Dinosaurs</h2>
            <p>Herbivorous dinosaurs were adapted to consume large quantities of plant material. Their teeth were often flat and suited for grinding vegetation. Dinosaurs like the Diplodocus had long necks to reach high vegetation, while others like the Stegosaurus had defensive plates and spikes.</p>

            <p>These dinosaurs played a crucial role in their ecosystems by consuming plants and providing food for carnivorous dinosaurs. Their feeding habits also influenced the evolution of plant life during the Mesozoic era.</p>
